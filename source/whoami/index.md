hi, i'm ENAILIS, shorten to ENA most of the time. i recently graduated with an engineering degree in cybersecurity and data science.
i spend most of my time making music and nerding about OSINT, video games and politics (this could be a dominic fike song title). i try to create some tools that will make my life easier when i'm not trynna learn new things.

since there's no root-me icon on fontawesome here's the link of [my profile](https://www.root-me.org/ENA?lang=en) (im not very active there)

i'll use this blog to post about some things that interest me enough to write something about it.
