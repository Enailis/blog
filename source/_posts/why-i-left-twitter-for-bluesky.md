as you might have noticed im not really active on twitter anymore. there's a lot of reasons for this and i wanted to talk about this here so here it goes

## fuck elon

one of the first reason i left twitter is because of elon musk. as you might have guessed im not a big fan of the guy mostly because he is a far-right transphobic piece of shit but also because he made twitter a place infected by fake informations, racism, LGBTQ+phobia, and overall fascists shit. the fact that fascists can blalently tell lies, while being pushed on everyone timeline by the algorithm, without facing any repercussion whatsoever is a big problem. also, staying on twitter means giving musk money by seeing the unfathomable amount of ads.

for the past 2 years, twitter has had a huge impact on my mental health for the reasons stated above and i cant take it anymore.

## why bluesky?

first of all: there's an active moderation (unlike twitter).
this sounds like something every single social medias should have but for some reasons it's not.

most importantly it's because it's a healthy place where you can have conversations without fearing of being harassed or facing misinformation. bluesky replicate what the "old twitter" felt like while having better toolings to shape your feed however you want.

for me this is not about nostalgia; it's about reclaiming an online place where i can foster real interaction, real connection without having a constant layer of toxicity in front of me.

## is bluesky an echo chamber?

no.

our view of social media has changed into a weird thing where facing insults have become the average interaction, where having a conversation is a form of fight. you always have to be ready to face the worse thing ever every single second you interact with random people. it should not be like this and bluesky is making it possible (at least at the time writing this). this place does not shut down the opposing point of view, it just forces it to express itself without bad-faith argument of straight up harassment.

the problem that twitter is facing is not about stumbling upon an opposing point of view post but about the never-ending amount of hate, harassment, and lies that are all rewarded by the algorithm. for people that are part of marginalised community (so most of my friends and me), it's not about escaping a disagreement, it's about creating a place where we can discuss without having to constantly defend our right to exist.

## conclusion

i'll probably use twitter just to announce the new things i make, like blog posts, upcoming videos, music, etc. but i'll only be active on bluesky. if you know me only for my IT stuff you'll discover a new side of me (i shitpost a lot and mostly in french, you've been warned).
